# Carol's Cookie's Checkout

This project enables Carol's Cookies to pass off the WooCommerce checkout to Run Payments for credit
card tokenization and capture. WHen there is a valid charge, the user is passed back to the
WooCommerce checkout with the appropriate data and the user is taken to the Order Confirmation page.

This template was built on Next.js using the App Router and Server Components / Actions. The app 
utilizes Sass Modules and React Bootstrap for an reliable and efficient framework.
